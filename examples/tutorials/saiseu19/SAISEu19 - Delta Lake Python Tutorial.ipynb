Tutorial Summary\n\n#### Full support for batch and streaming workloads\n* Delta Lake allows batch and streaming workloads to concurrently read and write to Delta Lake tables with full ACID transactional guarantees.\n\n#### Schema enforcement and schema evolution\n* Delta Lake provides the ability to specify your schema and enforce it. This helps ensure that the data types are correct and required columns are present, preventing bad data from causing data corruption.\n\n#### Table History and Time Travel\n* Delta Lake transaction log records details about every change made to data providing a full audit trail of the changes. \n* You can query previous snapshots of data enabling developers to access and revert to earlier versions of data for audits, rollbacks or to reproduce experiments.\n\n#### Delete data and Vacuum old versions\n* Delete data from tables using a predicate.\n* Fully remove data from previous versions using Vaccum to save storage and satisfy compliance requirements.\n\n#### Upsert data using Merge\n* Upsert data into tables from batch and streaming workloads\n* Use extended merge syntax for advanced usecases like data deduplication, change data capture, SCD type 2 operations, etc."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Join the community!\n\n\n* [Delta Lake on GitHub](https://github.com/delta-io/delta)\n* [Delta Lake Slack Channel](https://delta-users.slack.com/) ([Registration Link](https://join.slack.com/t/delta-users/shared_invite/enQtNTY1NDg0ODcxOTI1LWJkZGU3ZmQ3MjkzNmY2ZDM0NjNlYjE4MWIzYjg2OWM1OTBmMWIxZTllMjg3ZmJkNjIwZmE1ZTZkMmQ0OTk5ZjA))\n* [Public Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/delta-users)"],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"name":"SAISEu19 - Delta Lake Python Tutorial","notebookId":1421683953240744},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
